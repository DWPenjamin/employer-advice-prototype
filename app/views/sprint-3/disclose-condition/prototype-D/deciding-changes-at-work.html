      <p class="govuk-body">Changes to how {{ data['employeeName'] }} works could be needed. Things like reduced hours, different shifts or avoiding some duties can help.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Changes that might help physical conditions include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>wheelchair access</li>
        <li>a different desk or chair</li>
        <li>specialist equipment, like a keyboard for people with arthritis</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should ask {{ data['employeeName'] }} if any of these changes would help them. You can make suggestions, but it’s important to let them take the lead if possible.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Make the changes if you can</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Changes to the workplace are called reasonable adjustments. This means you must make the changes if they are reasonable for your business.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Changes might be reasonable if they are practical, affordable for your business and they won’t harm anyone else.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Examples of workplace adjustments - Equality and Human Rights Commision</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you do not think the changes are reasonable</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the changes are too expensive, there might be help available. Employees can use the Access to Work scheme to pay for some things, but only if you cannot provide them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Access to Work - support for your employees</a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If changes are not practical for your business or the type of job, you should try to agree another option together.</p>
