      <p class="govuk-body">Employees who are disabled or who have health conditions should not be disadvantaged when doing their jobs.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">As the employer you are responsible for making sure your employee is not disadvantaged. You may need to make changes to the workplace or the way your employee can do their job.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">These changes are called ‘reasonable adjustments’ and they are required by law.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must talk to your employee about what changes they might need when they return to work.</p>
