      <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">What to say</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">The purpose of getting in touch with an employee is to reassure them that they can return to work when they are better. Your employee shouldn’t feel pressured to return sooner than they want to.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you’re not sure what to say, follow these guidelines on <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-to-say-to-someone-who-is-sick">what you should and shouldn’t say to a sick employee</a>.</p>

          How often to get in touch

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">How often to get in touch</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">There are no rules for how often to get in touch. You and your employee should discuss what is appropriate for you both.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">When your employee first goes off sick it’s a good idea to get in touch every week. Because your employee has been off for more than 3 months, you might not need to get in touch so frequently.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">However, you should still agree a schedule for when you will get in touch with your employee.</p>

          What methods of communication to use
      -->

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">What methods of communication to use</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use whatever method feels most comfortable and appropriate for both you and your employee. It could be a text message, social media message, email, letter, phonemail, or face to face meeting.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Keep a record of when you’ve been in touch and a brief overview of what you discussed. This can be helpful in case there is a dispute in the future.</p>
